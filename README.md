# Final_Project_ML_For_Cybersec
Final project of the Machine Learning for Cyber Security course

The ubiquitous presence of Android smartphones has attracted a surge of malicious applications (malware). Existing malware detection methods often struggle to keep pace with the evolving landscape of threats. This research investigates the efficacy of employing machine learning (ML) techniques for robust multiclass classification of Android malware. We evaluate seven diverse ML models, encompassing ensemble learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) and a deep learning architecture (CNN-LSTM), on a comprehensive dataset of 18,998 Android APKs categorized into five distinct classes: adware, banking malware, SMS malware, riskware, and benign applications. To address data imbalance, we implement feature selection and SMOTE oversampling. Our extensive evaluation reveals that ensemble learning methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, achieve superior performance, exceeding 90% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across all malware categories. The deep learning model (CNN-LSTM) also demonstrates promising results, suggesting its potential for further optimization. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble learning and deep learning approaches in tackling the multifaceted challenge of multiclass Android malware classification. Future research avenues include exploring alternative classification strategies, incorporating contemporary datasets, and optimizing model hyperparameters for enhanced generalizability and robustness.
